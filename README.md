**WHAT I LEARN**

A personal project in the Unity Engine scripted in Java Script. I am using this project to learn the basis of the Unity Engine and to learn the C# programming language. I also wanted to understand what the start of the game development process was like.

I have learned what's look like the real game scripting and how to fix the errors you got for your script. Because while you are making a game you are facing with a lot of problems and it's really a good feeling to solve this problems after hours of searching and trying with yourself..

**Most important part is showing me the main idea behind of programming, how to overcome the problems and keep the motivation as how you began the project.  This was really helpful for improving my skills :)**

**SOFTWARE**
This project runs on the Unity engine. Make sure to have the newest version installed before running the project. The project folder is called "Tower Defense Unity Project".
